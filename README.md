# Features:

A JSON file stored all the data about the projects I've created.

I've used Pug to build templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I've used Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project
This project demonstrates my comfortable working knowledge of Node.js, Express and Pug, setting up a server, handling requests, working with server-side JavaScript, and building a powerful and modern back end project.
